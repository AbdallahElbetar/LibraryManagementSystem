# Library Management System

A console-based Java application for managing a library,
showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
Built as a personal project to demonstrate Java development skills for my portfolio.

## Overview
This project simulates a library management system where:
- Books can be added, removed, and displayed.
- Users (Students and Teachers) can be added, removed, borrow, and return books.
- A Librarian manages books and users, and generates reports.
